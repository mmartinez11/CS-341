-- 10.	Write a SQL query linking each author to their probable political bias, based on the articles theyâ€™ve written.

-- Order the results alphabetically by author name, from greatest number of articles to least, and alphabetically by bias in the case of a tie.

SELECT author, political_bias, COUNT(*) AS numArticles
